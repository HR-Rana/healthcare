						<p>Every successful health or weight loss story starts with one thing... And even though it's critical most people don't know about it.
						And no, it's not the program you use... even though this is important.
						It's not the diet you choose... even though this is, once again, important.
						But this missing link is the reason why some people see great success with any weight loss or fitness program they try... and others can put in hours of hard work and still be exactly where they started.
						Because there's plenty of great workout programs and diets out there... and many of them work!
						But if you're like most people... then you probably haven't gotten the results you've been looking for even though you've been working hard. Harder than most.
						Or maybe you were able to get some results, but they weren't sustainable.
						Either way it's because of one missing link.

			<h2>The Vibration You Bring to Everything You Do</h2>

				<div class="section-4-text">
					<p>Your beliefs. Your energy. The feeling you bring to everything you're doing.
					When you're not aligned with yourself. With The Universe. With everything around you... nothing works exactly as it should.
					All of the top athletes in the world know this on a subconscious level, but this applies to everything in life from losing weight, to living healthier, to succeeding in other areas.
					Just imagine if Michael Jordan, Tom Brady or Serena Williams lived in a constant state of frustration or deprivation... We would have never heard of them!
					They predominantly stayed in a high-vibrational state regarding their bodies and athletics which is one of the reasons they've been so successful!

					<p>A program that only focuses on the physical isn't enough, but neither is a program that focuses purely on the mental or emotional.

					In it I'll show you exactly how to improve, adjust, and tune into the right vibration.
					How to eat healthily without starving or depriving yourself of foods you love.
					How to find and do exercise you'll love... even if you've never been a fan of exercise!
					And how to achieve a healthier, happier, more confident self.
					Here's exactly how we'll do that:

			<h2>30 Day Power to Thrive Guarantee</h2>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>I know that this program works, and works well, but I know you can’t be 100% confident it’s for you until you see everything for yourself. That’s why I recommend you do the following: get the course today, try it out for 30 days, and if anytime within that time - whether it’s 29 minutes or 29 days later- you’re unhappy with it… just email me for a complete refund. </p>

			<h2>FAQs</h2>
			<div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list1">
							<h3>I don’t have free time, how much time do I need? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>The beauty of this program is that you only need 25-30 minutes per day for the workouts. Of course, you can do more but it is not needed. Plus, you can do it in your living room, backyard or garage so there is no time needed for travel.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list2">
							<h3>I have been inactive for 5 years, can I start this program? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Absolutely, and you will feel much better when you do. This program is created to meet people where they currently are and build from there. For beginners, it will give them easy, very short workouts to wake up the muscles and the cardiovascular system, but even if you’ve been working out for a while, you’ll benefit from it.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list3">
							<h3>Does this program allow meat and dairy? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, it will give you great flexibility and freedom in your meal plans. It can tailor to your needs in a simple and efficient manner. You choose from a large list of meal plans according to your goals, preferences and food availability. In addition, you can easily exchange foods with a quick switch in the menu items.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list4">
							<h3>I don’t like boring cardio, how much cardio do we need? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>The workouts will not be limited to long steady workouts on the treadmill, bike or elliptical. The routines involve circuit training, where you move from one exercise to another with short rests, which in itself is a form of cardio. On your other days, it is recommended to do your favorite activity, which could be sports, walking, martial arts, or traditional cardio. You choose your path. The at-home circuit training alone will give results, however.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list5">
							<h3>Can overweight and obese people do this program? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, absolutely, people who are above their ideal weight can find relief and added happiness by starting with our beginner program. Even if they were to just adopt the mental, emotional and spiritual lessons in addition to the meal plans, they could experience excellent results until they are ready to begin simple walking and then circuit training when they feel ready. The key is to start moving in the right direction as soon as possible.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list6">
							<h3>I don’t need to lose weight, will this program help me? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>For sure, being at a healthy weight does not mean that you are optimally fit. Anyone can benefit from increased strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, stamina, and a healthy meal plan. Plus, the lessons geared for enhancing your emotional, mental and spiritual well-being are priceless for overall success and happiness in life.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list7">
							<h3>Do we have to go to a gym, I’d rather be outside? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>You can do the workouts anywhere! I have had my most enjoyable sessions while training in the mountains, on the beaches and in the jungles. So the world is your gym.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list8">
							<h3>How soon before I see results? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>People can experience a sense of freedom and personal power immediately. The mental, emotional and spiritual lessons can be applied on day 1, which leads to an improved quality of life and happiness. Physically, as soon as you start eating better and training, you will feel more alive, energetic, confident and less lethargic and dull. People have experienced improved sleep right away and decreased stress levels. Your body will start making changes right away, and you can feel the results happening. The timeline for the weight to drop and the muscles to tone will be different for everyone. But, people have lost one to three pounds and more within the first week, if they follow a low-calorie meal plan. However, this program is all about a lifestyle change, and one that promotes proper maintenance of health. The most important thing is that you start and all of your improvements will start adding up right now. The next month will pass whether you make changes or not, wouldn’t you rather be healthier, happier, and leaner by this time next month?</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list9">
							<h3>What if I don’t feel like working out can I still get results? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, people can see physical results from improving their nutrition alone. The other powerful lessons on improving your spiritual, emotional and mental wellbeing are game-changers, even if you just apply those lessons. However, chances are that once you see them and feel the results of the nutrition program and additional lessons in this master class, that you will be beyond motivated to get moving. The material in here will make you want to train. You see your body as something you want to appreciate and take care of, like your favorite sports car.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list10">
							<h3>Can we eat carbs on this program? I can’t give up my bread and pasta? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, if the people in France and Italy can do it, and stay slim as can be, why can’t you? Our meal plans offer great flexibility and variety. You will find your path to reach your goals with the types of food you want. This program teaches you how to be friends with your food, and have a healthy relationship with what you eat.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list11">
							<h3>I like working out, but I don’t want to diet. Will I still get results? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, you can receive many benefits from all of the other parts of the program, namely the emotional, spiritual and mental well-being. In addition, physical training alone can improve your health, strength, endurance, stamina, flexibility, and balance. However, to achieve optimal results you will need to incorporate proper nutrition. You don’t need to call it a diet, it is simply a meal plan that you choose. </p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="faq-text" id="list12">
							<h3>Can diabetics do this program? <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
							<p>Yes, diabetics can benefit greatly from utilizing this program. The mental, emotional and spiritual lessons will give added power and self-confidence. Their physical training will help to gain strength, stamina, endurance, flexibility and balance. With proper exercise and nutrition, anyone can lose weight if that is their goal. Reaching and maintaining proper body weight is a key goal for diabetics to restore their health. In addition, diabetes is reversible, it is very important to take action as soon as possible. The sooner you can reach a healthy weight and control your blood sugars, the more of a chance you have at reversing diabetes. On a special note, it is crucial for all those with metabolic conditions to consult with their doctor, health physician and/or registered dietician before engaging in an exercise program or meal plan as everyone’s situation is different and special considerations need to be addressed regarding medications and other factors.</p>
